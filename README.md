Gastrointestinal Cancer Biomarker Discovery
Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my master's thesis project, which focused on the identification of protein biomarker panels for the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. The project leverages antibody microarray data to uncover tumor-specific protein signatures across gastric, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers.

Diagnosing GI tract malignancies remains challenging and resource-intensive, with current molecular markers lacking the accuracy needed for reliable tumor differentiation. Early and precise detection is crucial for patient survival, driving the need for improved biomarker panels.
Approach

Antibody Microarray Profiling: Secretomes from various GI cancer cell lines were analyzed to detect distinct protein expression patterns.
Clinical Relevance: Identified markers were cross-referenced with blood serum samples from patients to assess their diagnostic potential in accessible clinical material.
Statistical Analysis: Sensitivity and specificity of candidate marker panels were evaluated, with a particular focus on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Machine Learning: Classification algorithms were trained to predict diagnostic value and enhance the robustness of biomarker selection.

Key Results

Identification of protein marker panels with high sensitivity and specificity for PDAC and other GI cancers
Demonstration of machine learning models for robust classification based on protein expression data
